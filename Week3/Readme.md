# Week 3: Problem Statements

## Program 1: Half Adder

Write a verilog program to model a half adder. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the AND gate truth table.

## Program 2: Full Adder

Write a verilog program to model a full adder. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.

## Program 3: 2:1 Multiplexer

Write a verilog program to model a 2:1 multiplexer. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.

## Program 4: 4:1 Multiplexer

Write a verilog program to model a 4:1 multiplexer. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.

## Program 5: Ripple Carry Adder

Write a verilog program to model a 4 bit ripple carry adder. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.
