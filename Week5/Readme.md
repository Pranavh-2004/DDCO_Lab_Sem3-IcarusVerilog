# Week 5: Problem Statements

## Program 1: Register File

**Aim**: Construct a register file that allows the following operations:

- Read two 16-bit values from the register file in a single clock cycle.
- Write one 16-bit value to the register file in a single clock cycle.

## Program 2: Register File and ALU Integration

**Aim**: Integrate a register file with an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to perform the following:

- Read two 16-bit values from the register file as inputs to the ALU.
- Use the ALU to perform computations on the inputs.
- Write the computed 16-bit result back to the register file in a single clock cycle.
