# Week 6: Problem Statement

## Program: 16-bit Program Counter

**Aim**: Implement a 16-bit Program Counter (PC) with the following functionality:

- Increment the PC by 1 on every clock cycle.
- Load a specific 16-bit address when a load signal is asserted.
- Subtract - The PC can decrement or adjust based on the sub and offset signals.
- Reset the PC to `0x0000` when a reset signal is asserted.
